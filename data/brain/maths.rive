This is what its remainders look like:\n\n2519 / 2 = 1259 remainder 1\n2519 / 3 = 839 remainder 2\n2519 / 4 = 629 remainder 3\n2519 / 5 = 503 remainder 4\n2519 / 6 = 419 remainder 5\n2519 / 7 = 359 remainder 6\n2519 / 8 = 314 remainder 7\n2519 / 9 = 279 remainder 8\n2519 / 10 = 251 remainder 9|Look at these sums:\n\n142857 x 2 = 285714\n142857 x 3 = 428571\n142857 x 4 = 571428\n142857 x 5 = 714285\n142857 x 6 = 857142\n\nIn every answer the same six digits (142857) reappear in the same order but starting at a different point. This pattern continues except for 7, which is a law unto itself:\n142857 x 7 = 999999\nTry 8 and 9 and the pattern reappears, though with a difference:\n\n142857 x 8 = 1142856\n142857 x 9 = 1285713\n\nWhat pattern? 1142856 and 1285713 look nothing like 142857, or so you might think. But remove the first digit of each number and add it to the rest and see what we get:\n\n142856 + 1 = 142857285713 + 1 = 285714\n\nThe pattern persists even with larger numbers:\n\n142857 x 16 = 2285712 and 285712 + 2 = 285714\n142857 x 29 = 4142853 and 142853 + 4 = 142857\n142857 x 34 = 4857138 and 857138 + 4 = 857142\n142857 x 51 = 7285707 and 285707 + 7 = 285714\n142857 x 64 = 9142848 and 142848 + 9 = 142857\n\nOnce you start to multiply by even larger numbers the pattern alters again.
